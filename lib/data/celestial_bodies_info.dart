String solarSystemInfo = """
The solar system consists of the Sun and everything that orbits around it, including planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. At the center lies the Sun, a yellow main-sequence star that provides light, heat and energy to the rest of the solar system. Orbiting at an average distance of 150 million kilometers is the planet Mercury, the smallest and fastest planet, completing three rotations around the Sun every two years. Venus is the second planet and the hottest in the solar system due to its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere trapping heat. Earth, the third planet, is unique in harbouring life and liquid water on its surface. The Red Planet Mars has a thin atmosphere and two small moons - Phobos and Deimos. In the outer solar system lie the four gas and ice giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter is the largest planet, containing two and a half times the matter of all other planets combined. Its four largest moons Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. 

Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt containing Pluto and other dwarf planets like Haumea, Makemake and Eris. This disk-shaped region also contains smaller objects composed mostly of ice. Even farther out lies the spherical Oort Cloud containing trillions of icy objects surrounding the solar system. Periodically, comets get knocked inwards towards the Sun from this cloud. Comets develop a visible coma and sometimes a tail when they approach the inner solar system. Asteroids are rocky remnants that mostly reside between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the Asteroid Belt. The largest, Ceres, is around 950 km in diameter and considered a dwarf planet itself. Interestingly, asteroid Psyche may be the exposed core of a destroyed protoplanet. Meteoroids that get pulled into Earth's atmosphere are called meteors. If they reach the ground intact, these chunks of comet and asteroid material are called meteorites.

The solar system likely formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. Gravity caused the nebula to collapse and matter to condense at the center forming the Sun. Conservation of angular momentum caused the flattened spinning disk of leftover material which eventually formed the orbiting planets. The solar system remains gravitationally bound to the Sun and continues to evolve over astronomically long timescales.

Mercury orbits the Sun every 88 Earth days and has a rotation period of 59 Earth days, so a solar day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. Mercury has essentially no atmosphere to help retain heat, so its surface experiences extreme temperatures ranging from 100°C during the day to -173°C at night. Mercury has a very thin atmosphere of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium. It has a large iron core equal to 60% of its planetary mass. Mercury's surface is covered in craters like other terrestrial planets. It has no signs of plate tectonics or volcanoes. Scientists think Mercury shrank slightly as its core cooled and solidified over billions of years."

Venus is a terrestrial planet with a rocky surface covered in craters, volcanoes and lava plains. It is often described as Earth's twin because they are similar in size, mass and density but Venus has evolved to become an extremely hot world with a dense, toxic atmosphere. It has no moons and orbits the Sun every 225 Earth days. Venus spins backwards very slowly with its day lasting longer than its year. Its atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen with clouds of sulfuric acid. These thick clouds completely envelop Venus, producing a runaway greenhouse effect on its surface. Venus has no magnetic field and its surface pressure is 92 times greater than Earth's. It is believed Venus may have had oceans and a more Earth-like environment in the distant past before a runaway greenhouse effect transformed it."
